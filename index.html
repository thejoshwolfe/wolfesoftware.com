      <p>
        <a href="snakefall/">Snakefall</a> - A clone of <a href="http://snakebird.noumenongames.com/">Snakebird</a> by Noumenon Game.
        It includes a level editor for making user made levels.
        Check out the <a href="https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/snakefall/wiki">github wiki</a> for a list of levels made by the community.

        <a href="http://superjoe.s3.amazonaws.com/temp/legend-of-swarkland.html">Legend of Swarkland</a> -
        A hack-n-slash roguelike dungeon crawler inspired by <a href="http://www.nethack.org/">Nethack</a>.
        Pick up and use potions and wands, level up, reach the boss, and outsmart him.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="vapor/">Vapor</a> - A platformer work-in-progress.
        I have big dreams for this game, but little to show for it, hence the name: short for vaporware.
        So far it's just an experiment to create satisfying platformer physics.
      </p>

      <h1>Utilities for Games</h1>
      <p>
        I've made a number of simple web apps that assist playing other games.
      </p>
      <h2>Smash Up</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="factions/">Faction Shuffler</a> - Choses randomly from a set of faction names.
        Supports blacklisting/whitelisting and importing custom factions.
        Mobile friendly.
      </p>
      <h2>Betrayal at House on the Hill</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="betrayal/">Character Card Tracker</a> -
        Track character stats on a laptop instead of the cardboard pentagons with black coffin tokens.
        Includes a dice roller for convenience.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="betrayal-simulator/">Experimental Enhanced Game Assistant</a> -
        The above plus simulates shuffling and drawing from the decks of cards (not rooms or player pieces).
        Can run some of the basic events, like Night View and Creepy Doll, with a single button.
      </p>
      <h2>Star Wars Mafia</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="mafia-shuffle/">Card Shuffler</a> -
        A variant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)">Mafia/Werewolf</a>,
        Star Wars Mafia has character cards that must be dealt out randomly.
        This program allows you to select which characters should be in the game, and then tells you the order.
      </p>
      <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="dice-roller/">Dice Roller</a> - D6 dice roller specialized for <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/">GURPS</a>.
        Supports huge numbers of dice, shows history, and has hotkeys for everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="segmantis/">Stopwatch</a> - It's just a stopwatch, and not a very good one.
        I used it to time myself while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0a2_j5wyL8">speedrunning Riven</a>.
      </p>

      <a name="academia"></a>
      <h1>Academia</h1>
      <p>
        I've done various projects to test my mastery of certain topics.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="maze-generator/">Maze Generator</a> - Explore different maze generation algorithms and different topologies.
        The project has interactive step-by-step rendering that illustrates how different algorithms work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="just-n-time/">just-n-time</a> - A physics sandbox inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid_(video_game)">Braid</a>.
        Control the forward/backward flow of time for four different sets of objects independently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Demos that isolate the different types of power in a video game:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="avatar-strength/">Avatar Strength</a> - Your "avatar", i.e. your character, gets stronger.
            In this game you gain the ability to mine blocks faster by mining more blocks.
            There is no skill involved; your avatar is only as strong as the game allows.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="skill-game/">Skill Game</a> - The only thing that determines how well you perform is your skill at the game.
            The game mechanics are simple to learn, and there are no power ups.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="memory-game/">Memory Game</a> - Similar to skill,
            memorization enables the player to master a game by simply learning the arbitrary mechanics of how the game works.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="luck-game/2/">Luck Game</a> - A type of power that does not involve the player or the avatar,
            power in this game comes from purely random chance.
            This game is effectively a slot machine.
            I also made a luck-based game simplified to the extreme <a href="luck-game/">here</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
