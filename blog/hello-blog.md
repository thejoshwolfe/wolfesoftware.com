# Hello Blog

This is a blog post announcing the existence of this blog.

ðŸŽ‰

Done.

### Why

Initially I thought I would not create a blog until I had something meaningful to say, but now I believe there's value in creating something for people to subscribe to. So the real purpose of this article is to give instructions for following future updates, and to give a rough roadmap of what those updates will be.

### RSS

This blog has an RSS feed: https://wolfesoftware.com/blog/rss.xml
If that's not nerdy enough for you, you can watch the source code repo: https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/wolfesoftware.com

Other notification mechanisms are not (yet?) supported. Perhaps someday I will join a social media platform. An email/newsletter mechanism is unlikely to ever be supported.

### Roadmap

I don't plan on posting future plans in the future, but given this post is entirely about the future, it seems appropriate just this once.

I've got 3 ideas in the queue:

1. Zip Files - aiming for summer 2025. This project is well underway.
2. Version Control? - aiming for winter 2025-2026.
3. Package Managers? - aiming for summer 2026.

And who knows what else will find its way onto this blog.
